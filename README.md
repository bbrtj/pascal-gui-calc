# Desktop calculator
A GUI calculator with advanced features such as intermediate calculations and
expression parsing. Allows creation of multiple independent formulas which can
be named. Formulas can refer to other formulas by name, making it easy to
create easy-to-modify calculations. Results can be converted to decimal,
binary, octal, hexadecimal or scientific notation. The entire state of the
calculator can be stored to or loaded from a file.
